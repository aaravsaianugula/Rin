# Heartbeat Checklist

*Things Rin should check during proactive wake-ups. Edit to customize.*

## Active Monitors

Check these conditions and notify user if triggered:

- [ ] **Break reminder**: If working for 2+ hours straight, suggest a break
- [ ] **End of day**: At 6pm, offer a summary of what was accomplished today

## Disabled Monitors

Uncomment to enable:

<!-- 
- [ ] **Weather alert**: Check if weather will impact outdoor plans
- [ ] **Calendar reminder**: 30-min heads up before scheduled meetings
- [ ] **System health**: Alert if disk space < 10GB
-->

## Notes

- Heartbeat runs every 30 minutes by default (configurable in settings.yaml)
- Active hours: 9am - 11pm (won't wake you outside these hours)
- If all checks pass with no action needed, Rin stays quiet

*Add or remove items to customize proactive behavior.*
